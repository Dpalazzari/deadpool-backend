### Deadpool

This is the back end API for the DEADPOOL app for MCU

### Requirements

Install postgres, and create deadpool database:

```
createdb deadpool
â–¶ psql deadpool
psql (11.2)
Type "help" for help.

deadpool=#
```

Install consul (I typically do this through homebrew) and set up your consul cluster like so: 

!["public-key-image"]("Screen Shot 2019-04-30 at 9.02.37 PM")
